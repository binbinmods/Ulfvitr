    "CharacterDescription": "Ulfvitr trudged through the misty forests of Senenthia, his old bones aching with each step. Something was off - he could smell it in the air, feel it in the earth beneath his paws. The Wise Wolf had seen many moons, but this... this was different. With a low growl, he pressed on, determined to root out whatever darkness had taken hold in his beloved lands. \n Years ago, during the bloody Wolf Wars, Ulfvitr had crossed paths with Gorio, a rival shaman with an uncanny ability to bend wolves to his will. Their clash of ideologies came to a head when Gorio, driven by a lust for power, managed to capture Ulfvitr using forbidden rituals. Though Ulfvitr eventually broke free, the encounter left both physical and spiritual scars. Now, as storm clouds gathered overhead, the old werewolf wondered what shadow now looms over Senenthia.",
